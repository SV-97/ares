# ares
Finding areas of convex polygon masks (star domains) in images.

## How to use
The program requires two inputs. The first one is the actual image mask where the part we want to find the area of is coloured in black.

The second one is a normalization image with a black square of sidelength 1mm in the same resolution as the mask.

This input will produce some images telling you the inferred edges and polygon-vertices

as well as the following text
```
The area is 21.140775034293583 mmÂ². ~27 pixels are 1 mm.

## Internals
Internally this program roughly works as follows:
* Find the rough (non-horizontal) edges of the polygon by superimposing multiple copies on top of each other. We only consider non-horizontal edges because we can trivially reconstruct horizontal ones from that.
* Using a [Graham Scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) we find the convex hull of the points we got before.
* Clean up the edges by running linear interpolations on successively longer point-trails on the hull such that a configurable error isn't exceeded.
* Decompose the polygon into triangles to calculate the total area in pixels.
* Change units to millimeters.

An interesting alternative algorithm would be to use [Pick's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) or simple pixel counting.
